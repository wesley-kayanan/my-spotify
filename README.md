# Spotify (ETL) Sample Project

This is just a sample project to learn Data Engineering Concepts and the ETL procedure by applying it to the data extracted from the Spotify API. The program extracts and transforms data of my recently played tracks in Spotify ,and then can be loaded with a SQL database such as DBeaver. Most of the program incorporates the code taught by Karolina Sowinska in her Data Engineering Course for Beginners.
